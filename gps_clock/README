See the top level README for information on where to find the
schematic and programmers reference manual for the ARM processor
on the raspberry pi.  Also find information on how to load and run
these programs.

This is derived from the spi03 example which uses the Nokia 5110
display.  Also uses a generic 9600 baud gps receiver to extract accurate
time in nmea format.

Nokia 5110 to raspi

GND                P1-25    ground
VCC                P1-1     power
DIN (MOSI)         P1-19    data in, spi mosi
SCK/CLK            P1-23    spi clock
D/C                P1-22    data/command
RST                P1-26    reset
CS/CE              P1-24    spi chip select

GPS to raspi

VCC                P1-17 (3.3v)
GND                P1-6
TX                 P1-10


I will have to re-read my code or the docs some day but the math for
baud rate in case you have a 4800 or 1200 baud (or faster) gps
receiver output

//    PUT32(AUX_MU_BAUD_REG,270); //115200
    PUT32(AUX_MU_BAUD_REG,3254); //9600?

trim fraction off of (250000000/(8*baud))-1

I am not bothering to check the checksum, nor if it is even locked,
quick and dirty.

change this for your timezone.  or daylight savings

                        ra=5; //time zone adjustment
