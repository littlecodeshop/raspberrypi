See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

These examples are for the pi3, see other directories for other
flavors of raspberry pi.

This directory is for aarch32 mode (dont use a config.txt) and leaves
the ARM in HYP mode
