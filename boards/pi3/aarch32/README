See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

These examples are for the pi3, see other directories for other
flavors of raspberry pi.  The raspberry pi family is more similar than
different, but I have decided it is easier to manage by grouping the
examples by board type.

The pi3 contains a cortex-a8 ARM core, which is 64 bit.  It also
supports a legacy aarch32 mode which uses the traditional 32 bit
instruction set.  This directory contains instructions for aarch32
mode.

The aarch64 examples for now have to use a config.txt file to stay
in 64 bit mode.  These examples are like my normal examples where I
do not use a config.txt file.  So if you have one and things dont work
start by renaming it.

As of this writing the standard GPU bootloader puts the ARM in HYP
mode on its way to running kernel7.img. I now see how to switch back to
SVC.  So there is a directory of examples for staying in HYP mode and a
directory for switching to SVC mode.
