See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

It was asked how to detect which board you are on, specifically how to
know which peripheral base, they used a different cpu core on each
the pi1/zero armv6 based, pi2 armv7 based and pi3 armv8 based.  You
can just look at one of the cpuid registers.

This is a simple program, that can be run on any of the boards (so
far) and it will detect what base address it needs to use and then
print out some info.

Now that the bootloader (bootcode.bin + start.elf) support various
file names (kernel.img, kernel7.img, etc) and will grab the lesser
name if it cant find the one most relevant to that board, we can make
this just kernel.img and it works on all of them.
