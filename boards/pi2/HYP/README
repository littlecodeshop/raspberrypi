See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

These examples are for the pi2, see other directories for other
flavors of raspberry pi.  Specifically these examples are for running
in HYP mode.  As of this writing the GPU planted bootstrap places
the ARM in HYP mode.  These examples assume the ARM is in this mode
as it affects how you do things compared to SVC mode.
